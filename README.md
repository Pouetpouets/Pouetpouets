### When people ask me about my code...
> "Everything is working fine!" *[internal screaming]*

### About Me
- 🔨 I'm the kind of developer who breaks production and pretends everything is fine
- 🎭 Externally: "Yeah, I'm familiar with that technology!"
- 💭 Internally: *frantically googling what that technology is*
- 📚 Learning new frameworks (well, trying to)

### Technologies I Use (or at least pretend to understand)
```javascript
const skills = {
  frontend: ['React', 'TypeScript', 'Tailwind CSS'],
  tools: ['Git (mainly git add .)', 'VSCode'],
  currentlyLearning: 'AI-assisted development (because I need all the help I can get)'
}
```

### Fun Fact
⚡ I still don't know how to setup ESLint and Prettier in VSCode
(and at this point, I'm just adding semicolons randomly)

### My Daily Routine
1. ☕ Coffee
2. 💻 Code
3. 🐛 Create bugs
4. 😅 Hide the pain
5. 🔄 Repeat
